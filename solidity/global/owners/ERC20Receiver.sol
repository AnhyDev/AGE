/**
 * @title ERC20Receiver Abstract Contract
 * @dev This contract extends from IERC20Receiver, BaseUtility, and ERC165 interfaces.
 *      It provides functionalities for receiving ERC20 (ANHYDRITE) tokens and responding with a magic identifier.
 *      It uses the IERC1820Registry for handling standardized contract interface detection.
 * 
 *      Events:
 *      - DepositAnhydrite: Emitted when ANHYDRITE tokens are deposited.
 *      - ChallengeIERC20Receiver: Emitted to track from which address the tokens were transferred,
 *          who transferred them, to which address and the number of tokens.
 * 
 *      Functions include:
 *      - onERC20Received: Overridden from IERC20Receiver, handles incoming ERC20 token transfers.
