 * @title IERC1820Registry Interface
 * @dev This is an interface for the ERC1820 Registry contract, a central registry 
 *      used to discover which interface a particular address supports.
 * 
 *      The ERC1820 standard is a meta-standard that defines a universal registry smart contract 
 *      where any address (contract or regular account) can indicate which interface it supports.
 *
 *      Functions:
 *      - setInterfaceImplementer: Sets the contract which implements a specific interface for an address.
 *      - getInterfaceImplementer: Retrieves the address of the contract that implements a specific interface.
