# Anhydrite Gaming Ecosystem (AGE)

## Core Idea
The creation of a unified ecosystem for multiplayer server games that allows the integration of blockchain functionality via Binance Smart Chain. The system facilitates cryptocurrency and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) transactions directly within the gaming environment.

## Target Audience
- Gamers
- Game Server Administrators
- Game and Blockchain Developers

## Key Features
1. **Player Wallets**: The ability to create and manage cryptocurrency wallets directly in the gaming interface.
2. **Transactions and Transfers**: Interaction between players via transactions of various cryptocurrencies and tokens.
3. **Server Store**: For server administrators â€” the option to set up a proprietary in-game store, where players can purchase items, services, and get access to exclusive content via cryptocurrency.
4. **NFT Integration**: The creation, buying, selling, and exchange of NFT assets.
5. **Server Token**: The ability to create and use proprietary tokens as a primary or secondary in-game currency.
6. **Extension Modules**: Additional functionalities for voting, raffles, competitions, and charity events.

## Monetization
The basic set of functionalities is free. Additional modules and extended features are available for a fee in Anhydrite cryptocurrency, which will be burned after the transaction, thereby regulating its circulation and value.

## Security
High level of cryptographic security and compliance with regulatory standards for financial transactions.

## Scalability
The project is designed with future scalability and compatibility with new games and blockchains in mind.

## Conclusion
The Anhydrite Gaming Ecosystem aims to make cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology accessible and useful for the broader gaming community, providing new opportunities for both players and server administrators.
